## **What is it?**

This project is a solution to this [problem](https://gist.github.com/akitaonrails/711b5553533d1a14364907bbcdbee677)

## **Technologies and why**

* *Java with spring(boot, data, web)* - Reduce development and unit test time, scalable and realiable, large community, lots of good quality documentation, avoids write boilerplate code, provides embedded http servers. Actually it speaks for itself.
* *HSQLDB* - Lightweight embedded database, easy to migrate, accept in memory manipulation to integration tests. Do not require a local installed database system to easy up and running.
* *Flyway* - Powerful tool to migrate and assure database consistency on a continuous deployment/delivery.
* *Actuator* - It's always crucial to have a good monitoring mechanism with easy access, has a very simple integration with grafana and prometheus.
* *Swagger* - Very straightforward way to provide a good quality api documentation to developers.
* *Lombok* - Annotation processor to avoids repetitive code, makes code cleaner, speeds up development.
* *Junit/Mockito* - Code without tests are difficult to maintain, add new features, scale, keep track of what is running as expected. Most common tools for testing with java.
